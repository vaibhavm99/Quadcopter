# Description
As the name suggests, a quad drone is basically a flying vehicle with four electric motors and four propellers. When compared to other RC flying vehicles, the quad, as well as other multi-rotors, comes with the most stable platform, all thanks to its different design, and the direction and the difference between the four thrusts that it generates. This stability is why quads are perfect for aerial surveillance and filming. They come in all shapes and sizes. From the small ones that can fit in the palm of your hand, to the big ones that are capable of lifting serious filming equipment and gimbals. 

## Project Highlights
Quadcopter made using arduino as Flight Controller.
